* Relayout and prettify the whole thing
* Figure out the "Invalid component  1  in picker  <UIPickerView: ...." warning
** This is my own warning! See numberOfRowsInComponent in timeInput; where did these magic values come from? (google, really)
* Really need to vastly improve the timeInput (picker-based) widget - intrinsic size, layoutSubviews, etc.
* Rework the timeInput widget so it gives bigger fonts - maybe views rather than titles?
* Remember - you have a Github project for this, push updates so you can develop on multiple devices
* Rotation - need landscape layout
* Noise/other distraction on completion?
* Backport to iOS 7.X (deal with UIStackview -> OAStackview, and "no embedded dynamic frameworks" problem)

DONE

* BUG: when using the time choose segue, you can hit "Done" when no rows are selected; bang, assert in getChosenTime (nothing selected)
